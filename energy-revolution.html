Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that 2 degrees global warming comes with the cost of 43 trillion dollars in impact damages. Some of it paid by our government, which gets money from me and you.<br/>
Earth already warmed up by 1 degree. Because of that Earth is losing land suitable for growing crops. At the same time Earth's population increases.
With increasing demand and shrinking supply we are going to reach a point, where there is just not enough food to feed all humans.<br/><br/>

With more frequent droughts, sea level rise and extreme weather events increasing number of people will be forced to leave their home region.
They will come to other countries - in peace. Hopefully, as they have reasons to be angry at countries emitting greenhouse gasses.<br/>
Mankind is likely to survive, but other species are out of luck. Ocean acidification and other climate changes will disrupt food chains and extinct 1/3 of species.<br/>
The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it.

				<aside class="notes">
As Earth's temperature increases ice melts and is no longer trapping methane, which is a greenhouse gas. Melting ice turns areas that were reflecting light into areas that absorb Sun's energy.
Rainforest drying and more frequent forest fires release additional carbon dioxide. Increased temperature increases amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. All these feedbacks amplify the greenhouse effect, which increase the temperature, which cause more positive feedbacks.

Most likely not in this century, someday the Earth will warm so much, that it will never get cooler again. Runaway greenhouse effect happened on Venus where ocean evaporated and all that water vapor keeps the surface temperature above the boiling point, which prevents water condensation.<br/>
Even 16 degree warming would make most of our planet uninhabitable by humans. Wet bulb temperatures above 35°C can result in lethal hyperthermia as human body would not be able to remove excess heat.

				World energy supply
				<aside class="notes">
It's not that easy to stop using fossil fuels when 2/3 of electricity and 80% of total energy comes from them. They are very efficient source of energy. One liter of crude oil gives <a href="https://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-koe-to-kWh.html">10 kWh</a>. Physically working human can daily produce 1 kWh, so burning 1 liter of oil is like hiring 10 people for one day.

Average Pole daily needs 82 kWh for transportation, heating and electricity. 82 kWh every day is like hiring 82 people for your lifetime. From that point of view average Pole is a king with an army of servants. For many people that’s not enough.

We can do more with less. We can be more efficient with energy we have. For example petrol engine uses only 1% of energy from burning fossil fuels to move the driver. Most of energy goes to heat the engine and some to move one ton of steel along with the driver. 99% of energy is wasted - there is an area for improvement.

Public transportation has low energy consumption per passenger because it is serving multiple travelers with one trip. Additional advantage of trains is that they have their own lanes and don’t have to make unwanted stops. Busses can also have dedicated lanes which further lowers their energy consumption.

Increasing number of companies experiment with vacuum and low pressure tubes to achieve speeds around 1000 km/h. No drag means almost all energy used for acceleration can be recovered when decelerating. With same amount of energy that is used by a compact car to get us from Krakow to the Baltic Sea we could make a vacuum tube trip around the Earth, 12 times. That’s a bit abstract, what about something everyone could use this year.

People pay for energy to generate the heat, while there is plenty of excess heat out there. For example thermal power station generates large amounts of heat as a side effect of producing electricity. In Poland 90% of electricity comes from coal power plants. They already produce enough heat to cover heating needs of people in the city.

				<h2>Peer-to-peer energy</h2>
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_generation"><img src="img/renewable-energy-mini-grid.jpg" alt=""/></a>
				<aside class="notes">
Which introduces an interesting concept of distributed energy network. If I join a common energy network I can sell my excess heat or excess electricity to other peers. If I have spare money I can invest in electric or thermal battery, purchase resources when price is low and sell them when demand is high. Even energy consuming houses benefit from energy producing neighbors. Buying local electricity and heat avoids long distance transmission fees and energy loss.

You can also conserve the energy through small behavior changes like: fast venting during the winter to reduce the heat loss, turning things off when you are not using them, and using nearby resources instead of transporting them over a long distance.

Choosing local whole food provides all nutrients your body needs and prevents 14 leading causes of death. Convenience food requires significant amount of energy to turn that palm oil with salt and sugar into a delicious cookie, packaged like it’s precious, advertised and distributed worldwide. People eating processed food often intake too much saturated fat, have minerals and vitamin deficiency. Time and money people spend on healing their bodies can be easily avoided with a plant based diet.

On average we use 10 times more energy to produce the food, than the food is worth in terms of calories. Instead of beef we can choose local raw food, which is 70 times more energy efficient and does not involve killing or exploiting other beings. Because of low energy consumption plant based diet costs 3 PLN a day. No one is going to advertise that when you can make people think they need to spend 30 PLN a day on food and another <a href="http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Na-ochrone-zdrowia-wydajemy-ponad-100-mld-zl-rocznie-7216449.html" title="107800/38/365=">20 PLN</a> on <a href="http://www.pit.pl/skladka-zdrowotna-13118/">healthcare</a>.

While it is necessary for individuals to change their own behavior in the face of climate change, we need national level changes. Parliament needs to discontinue subsidizing the fossil fuel industry. Effective legislation is necessary to cut carbon emissions. When Marshall Saunders recognized that, he created CCL.

Independent research institutes published reports showing that a revenue neutral carbon fee and dividend: makes polluters pay, ensures people can afford the energy in transition time, makes clean energy a default choice as it becomes cheaper than fossil fuels, cause sustainable economic growth, and most importantly - prevents the damages done by the global warming.

Multiple studies were made aggregating tens of thousands research papers. 97% consensus is the most consistent.

Unfortunately, discussions where almost everyone agrees are not interesting, so media typically take one person from the 97% and one from the 3%. This creates balanced arguments that keep viewers excited waiting to find out which side is going to win.

This simplified energy equation keeps incoming and outgoing energies in balance.<br>
Amount of energy absorbed from the Sun's rays depends on solar constant L, ability to reflect light and the area of Earth's shadow.<br>
Outgoing energy is radiated by the Earth in each direction. It depends on two constants, surface temperature and area.<br>
Without atmosphere Earth's temperature would be -18°C.

Fortunately Earth's atmosphere contains greenhouse gasses. This slow motion animation shows carbon dioxide molecule dancing to the rhythm of Earth's infrared waves. Bending frequency matching frequency of infrared wave increases the chance that wave energy will be absorbed.<br/>
Water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone and methane absorb and re-radiate heat back to Earth.<br/>
